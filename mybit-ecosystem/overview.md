# Overview

## What is the MyBit Ecosystem? <a id="what-is-the-mybit-ecosystem"></a>

The MyBit Ecosystem is defined by the following:

* **MyBit Version 2**: a decentralised investing platform. It allows direct investment in assets.
* **MYDAX**: a decentralised exchange. It provides liquidity and trading to digital assets.
* **MyBit Network**: a protocol that allows the creation of decentralised digital assets, funding and trading. It also enables the distribution of revenue generated by assets.

Both MyBit v2 and MYDAX are web-hosted applications that connect to the MyBit smart contract platform to function. The MyBit Network is the business layer built under all these applications and on top of the Ethereum blockchain as a suite of Smart Contracts. By relying on the MyBit Network, anyone can build **Wealth Management Decentralised Applications** easily.
